## General Information
The main focus of our investigation based on borrower rate, state, income range, listing category, monthly loan payment and stated monthly income.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.5

## Setup
Before proceeding this project you need to download "Prosper Loan Data" from this url "https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv" file and then you need to download the "Prosper Loan Data-Variable Definitions.csv" file provided in our project dataset. 

## Usage
If you want a project template based on univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots this project would be very remarkable for you. 

Plus, the inferences from this project and the plots we created may be very valuable for people who works primarily based on banking sector. For example we tried to overview so many aspects of this prosper loan data owing to the dataset's including attributes such as listing keys, numbers, creation date etc. of loans. Similarly, they can evaluate our conclusions of this project and maybe they can draw a road map especially based on the loan programs of their company for the future periods.
